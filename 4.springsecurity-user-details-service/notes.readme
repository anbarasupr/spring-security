contextConfigLocation is the context parameter where we provide the spring security beans configuration file name. It is used by ContextLoaderListener to configure authentication in our application.

We have also added HttpSessionEventPublisher listener to publish session created/destroyed events to the Spring Root WebApplicationContext.

I am also setting session-timeout to 15 minutes, this is used for auto timeout when user is inactive for 15 minutes.

DelegatingFilterProxy is the application filter defined, it is used for intercepting the HTTP requests and performing authentication related tasks.

DispatcherServlet servlet is the front controller for the Spring MVC application




UserDetailsService
If we want to use any DAO class for authentication, we need to implement UserDetailsService interface. Once the DAO is configured, itâ€™s loadUserByUsername() is used to validate the user.
